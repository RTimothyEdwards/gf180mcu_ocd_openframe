Caravel Openframe for GF180MCU
--------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions are currently very incomplete.

The top level layout is "caravel_openframe.mag"

To create a new openframe chip with a custom user project:

(1) Clone or fork this repository
(2) Add verilog for the user project in ../verilog/rtl/
(3) The user project verilog top level should be named
    "openframe_user_project" in file "openframe_user_project.v",
    replacing the template file.
(4) If there are multiple verilog files in the user project,
    either include them from the top level verilog or add them
    to "netlists.v"
(5) Set the user ID for the project with ../scripts/set_user_id.sh.
(6) Do a top-level extraction for LVS with ../scripts/run_extract.sh
(7) Run LVS with run_lvs.sh in the ../lvs/ directory.
(8) Generate final GDS using the script ../scripts/run_gen_gds.sh
