This is a regeneration of the magic files for the simple_por
from the GDS as a "readonly" file.  The reason is that it
is the only cell in the caravel_openframe top level that is
not a library cell of some kind, so making it a read-only
library cell allows the top level cell to be generated
without hierarchical adjustments by magic, which greatly
speeds up the time to write the final GDS file.
